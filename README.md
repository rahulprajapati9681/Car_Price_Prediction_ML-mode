# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – ML Model
This project is a basic machine learning regression model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on key features such as brand, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. It uses Supervised Regression Algorithms and is a great starting point for beginners learning ML workflows.

# 📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict the price of a used car using historical data.

Model Type: Supervised Machine Learning – Regression

Dataset: Contains information like car name, company, year of purchase, kms driven, fuel type, etc.

# 🧠 Features Used
The following features are used to train the model:

- name: Car name/model

- company: Manufacturer

- year: Year of purchase

- kms_driven: Kilometers driven

- fuel_type: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/etc.)

# 🛠️ Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
(Other models like Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest can be added later for comparison.)
